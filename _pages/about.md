I am an undergraduate student at the University of Arizona majoring in physics and math. In addition to my passion for physics and math, I also have a keen interest in the medical field, and hope to combine these interests in research applying quantum computing to medicine. Currently, I am a research assistant in [Dr. Shenfeng Qiu's](https://phoenixmed.arizona.edu/directory/qiu-shenfeng) lab where I help conduct single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) computational analysis.

I am also an international award-winning classical concert pianist! I began studying with Mr. Fei Xu at the New Century Conservatory at the age of six, and have won numerous local, national, and international awards for my piano playing. At age 10, I made my orchestral debut playing Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 2 with the MusicaNova Orchestra, with whom I have also performed the 2013, 2016, and 2018 for their Young Artist Concert Series. In June 2021, I performed in the opening concert of the 2022 Season for the South Carolina Philharmonic as a guest artist, having won 1st place in the 2019 Arthur Fraser International Competition at the Southeastern Piano Festival. Feel free to check out my performances and further musings on music. Classical music is my passion, and I love sharing this part of my life with others!
